# RSS Feed Reader Testing Project

Project 6 for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree Program. The objective was to take a project from another developer and build a series of tests (utilizing *Jasmine*) to check funtionality of various elements.

## Installation
1. Download/clone the repo.
2. Launch `index.html` in your browser of choice!

- Jasmine's testing suites appear at the bottom of the page when loaded.
- To edit/add testing suites, open [`spec/feedreader.js`](spec/feedreader.js). All tests available there.


## Technology Stack
  **This project utilizes:**
  - Javascript
  - JQuery
  - **[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)**
  - HTML5/CSS

#### Special Thanks
As this is the final project in the Front-End program, once more I'd like to thank the Udacity instructors, coaches, forum mentors, as well as my classmates for their support and guidance over the course of this program.
